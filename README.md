# enviro-multisensor
This python code utilizes a lot of the capabilities of the Enviro+ HAT for Raspberry Pi. Because this code excludes usage of the particulate matter sensor, it would make for a compact, portable multisensor. To change between all the modules, simply tap the light sensor with your finger to toggle between each of the sensor readings!
